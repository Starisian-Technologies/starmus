# Repository Governance and Access Policy

_This policy applies specifically to the repository: `aiwa-governance` (or equivalent)._

## 1. Purpose

This policy governs access to the AiWA Governance Repository, which contains culturally sensitive data, internal policy frameworks, consent protocols, and proprietary AI training resources. Access is restricted to protect the intellectual property, cultural rights, and human dignity of those who contribute to and are represented by the AiWA project.

## 2. Cultural and Legal Framework

This repository contains materials classified as **culturally sensitive** and **legally protected** under:

- The laws of **The Gambia**, including those governing oral traditions, indigenous knowledge, and community rights
- The laws of **California**, including intellectual property, digital consent, and cultural data protections

In developing and managing this repository, AiWA has aligned its practices with the **ethical research standards** of:

- The **Getty Research Institute**, especially regarding access to cultural materials, provenance, and community governance
- The **University of California** systemâ€™s protocols for **sensitive, indigenous, or culturally bound knowledge**

> **Note:** These institutions are not granted access to this repository. Rather, AiWA recognizes and voluntarily aligns with their policies to establish best practices in the handling of culturally sensitive, AI-relevant materials.

## 3. Authorized Users

Access is limited to:

- AiWA leadership and project staff
- Designated legal, technical, or cultural consultants
- Institutional partners operating under written agreement (NDA, MOU, or license)
- Academic researchers explicitly approved by the AiWA Cultural Board or project leadership

## 4. Access Levels

| Role                  | Access Granted                     |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| Admin (Owner)         | Full control: read/write + user management |
| Internal Contributor  | Read/write with review             |
| Cultural Advisor      | Read or suggest-only access        |
| External Partner      | Read-only (with expiring secure credentials) |

## 5. Access Conditions

- All users must agree to the LICENSE and TERMS before access
- MFA is required for any GitHub account with write access
- All write access must occur through protected branches with peer review
- Access is reviewed quarterly and revoked upon inactivity, breach, or role change
- The LICENSE file and TERMS must be reviewed and agreed upon before access is granted. These documents are legally binding and enforceable under California law.

## 6. Revocation

Access may be immediately revoked in cases of:

- Violation of this policy, especially cultural protection clauses
- Breach of dual-consent protocols or ethical handling of sensitive data
- Unauthorized distribution or public sharing of any material
- Any event that poses reputational, legal, or financial risk to AiWA
- Revocation decisions may be appealed in writing within 30 days to the AiWA Cultural Board.

- In addition to revocation of access, AiWA reserves the right to pursue legal remedies, including but not limited to monetary damages, injunctive relief, and equitable remedies, in cases of breach of this policy, misappropriation of culturally sensitive data, or violations of intellectual property law.
- It is understood that certain breachesâ€”particularly those involving unauthorized use, disclosure, or distribution of protected materialsâ€”may result in irreparable harm for which monetary damages alone would be inadequate. In such cases, AiWA may seek injunctive or other equitable relief as deemed necessary by a court of competent jurisdiction in San Diego County, California.

## 7. AI Training and Irrevocability

Materials accessed through this repository may be used to train AI models, including language models, speech recognition systems, and related technologies. Once these materials are used for training, the resulting models become **irreversible and non-extractable composites** of the data.

> **Contributors and cultural authorities waive the right** to retroactively restrict, recall, or demand modification of models trained on previously approved data. While AiWA may offer transparency and community consultation on future use cases, the **models themselves and any derivative systems remain the intellectual property of AiWA and its designated technical partners.**

All training is conducted under ethical, consent-based protocols. However, contributors should be aware that **model outputs may reflect patterns, structures, or phrasing derived from training data**, without directly reproducing the original content.
