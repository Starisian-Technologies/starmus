### Made for creators. Built for culture. Inspired by the stars. 

## 🌠 Why "Starmus"?

The name **Starmus** pays tribute to the [Starmus Festival](https://www.starmus.com/), founded by astrophysicist **Dr. Garik Israelian** and **Dr. Brian May** — the legendary guitarist of Queen and a PhD in astrophysics. Starmus is where **stellar science and cosmic sound converge**, bringing together visionaries like **Professor Stephen Hawking**, **Peter Gabriel**, astronauts, Nobel laureates, and iconic musicians.

This plugin, like the festival, is a bridge between **voice and vision**, built to capture **human expression** — whether it's an oral history from a rural village or a voice memo beneath the stars.

**Starmus Audio Recorder** is a small tool with a big mission: preserving stories, song, and spirit in their purest form.
